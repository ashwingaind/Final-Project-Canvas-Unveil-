        <h2>Anna Wiene</h2>
        <p class="p1">
            An artist whose work will make you think a lot and then make you question yourself, if that’s right? Her works are anything but simple, she likes to engage the viewers in her painting’s world and make them notice the details. 
            <br>

        <img class="annaw" src="images/annaw.png" alt="Anna's Works">
        <p class="p2">
            It can be seen that Anna's works are quite detailed and even real life scenarios can be seen. There is a lot going on and you would keep thinking.
            <br>
            <br>
            You will never just see one colour and notice a lot of things. Art is ambiguous, therefore you can interpret her works however you want, but there is a chance that you will discover new things when you take a look at them again.

            Julie Greve Lindholm
        </h2>
        <p class="p3">
            Julie is interested in human relations and how we interact with each other. Her inspiration comes from pictures and stills from the movies.  She generally uses oil on paper and you will notice many shades of the same colour in her works.

            Sit in the mud or walk your dog. Pause and hang with your head down. It will rain soon. Who is that sitting next to me? I might know her.
            <br>
            <br>
            These works are all painted from photos of people in nature. The medium is oil on paper and you can observe different shades of the same colour, there is a huge chance that you might miss on all the details when you lay your eyes on these paintings first.

        <h2 class="luise">
            Luise Faurholt
        </h2>
        <p class="p5">
            Luise works on paper with watercolour, marker or pencil. Large sheets and small fragments, which he sometimes sew together. Based on everyday life, he paints rooms, interiors, details and patterns.

        <div class="overlay3"></div>
        <p class="p6">
            The rooms that are empty, Library, Shelves and Red room, Luise has used watercolour on paper as his medium for all of these works. It is noticeable that he is meticulous and takes his time with each painting.

             The human figures are left as open outlines or appear blurred or vague. The action in the motif is omitted. What remains is an imprint, an absence.

            Mette Rix
        </h2>
        <p class="p7">
            Mette's expression lies in the line. The movement of the line, the pressure and expression of the line, the intensity of the line which gives narrative and direction. She is inspired by work processes and experiments coupled with an experience fund of techniques.

            The trilogy “Life Is Life” is made with linoleum cut technique on three linoleum sheets. The linoleum cuts are printed in such a way that the silk roads can be viewed on both side of the surface. The silk is light transparent and the printing ink goes through the silk, and thus can freely hang in the room.
